Linear search is a method for finding a target value within an array. It sequentially checks each element of the array for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched. Linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most n comparisons, where n is the length of the array.<br/><br/><br/>

#### Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n) - since in worst case we're checking each element exactly once.
