Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the array to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order (ascending or descending arrangement). The pass through the array is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the array is sorted.<br/><br/><br/>
