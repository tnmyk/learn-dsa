Selection sort is a sorting algorithm which has O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.<br/><br/><br/>
